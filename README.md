AI Deepfake Detection Platform

An AI-powered multi-media deepfake detection system that identifies manipulated images, videos, audio, and text using advanced machine learning models.

Built for detecting misinformation and improving digital trust in modern media.

 🚀 Problem Statement

Deepfakes are rapidly spreading across social media and news platforms, making it difficult to distinguish between **real and manipulated content**.

This leads to:

* Fake news and misinformation
* Identity fraud
* Political manipulation
* Loss of public trust in digital media

A reliable automated detection system is required.


 💡 Our Solution

We built a single platform that detects deepfakes across multiple media types:

1. Image Deepfake Detection
2. Video Deepfake Detection
3. Audio Deepfake Detection
4. Text Fake Detection

Users simply upload media, and our AI models analyze it and return a fake probability score with confidence level.
